2. Catalog information about Index
- Show your catalog information about an index (tables, columns). 


3. Block Nested Loop Join (If you have implemented this feature)
- Describe how your block nested loop join works (especially, how you manage the given buffers.)


4. Index Nested Loop Join (If you have implemented this feature)
- Describe how your grace hash join works.
For each record in the left iterator, we do a index search on the right to get the record and then join them.


5. Grace Hash Join (If you have implemented this feature)
- Describe how your grace hash join works (especially, in-memory structure).


6. Aggregation
- Describe how your aggregation (basic, group-based hash) works.
We use unordered_map to map the value of the group by attribute to a set of statistics including sum, count when we initilize the iterator. Then, we iterarively return the results computed in the map.

7. Implementation Detail
- Have you added your own source file (.cc or .h)?
No

- Have you implemented any optional features? Then, describe them here.
Yes, we implemented Grace Hash Join, Aggregation with gorup by.

- Other implementation details:


6. Other (optional)
- Freely use this section to tell us about things that are related to the project 4, but not related to the other sections (optional)
